## Project Title  
**Exam Question Generator and Answer Evaluator**

### Overview  
This application allows educators to:  
1. Generate custom exam questions for any subject and topic.  
2. Evaluate student answers with automated feedback and deductions for exceeding the allocated time.  

It uses the **LangChain framework**, **Gradio for the UI**, and **Pydantic models** to structure input/output for consistency and reliability.
